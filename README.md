Alan Turing’s “Computing Machinery and Intelligence” (1950) is a groundbreaking paper that explores whether machines can think, introducing the "Turing Test" as a way to evaluate machine intelligence. Instead of trying to define "thinking," Turing shifts the focus to observable behavior, proposing that if a machine can imitate human responses convincingly in a text-based interaction, it can be said to exhibit intelligence.

What makes Turing’s work remarkable is his anticipation of modern AI. He discusses learning machines that improve through experience, which aligns with today’s machine learning. He also addresses common objections, such as those based on consciousness and Gödel’s incompleteness theorems, with impressive logic.

The Turing Test, though influential, has been critiqued for focusing on imitation rather than true understanding. This debate has led to further philosophical inquiries, such as John Searle’s Chinese Room argument. Still, Turing’s core idea—that machines might one day rival human intelligence—was visionary. His work remains foundational as we continue to grapple with the nature of intelligence and the potential of AI.
